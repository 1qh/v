          It can be very rewarding when growth and transformation happens with someone else,
          especially if that other is dear to you. Having a partner or family member join you in a
          Meditation and Mindfulness program comes with many benefits. You become accountable for
          each other’s practice and there is encouragement from each other. But the most important
          thing is that you get to share in each other’s experiences and there is great learning in
          that. About the practice and about each other. What Meditation and Mindfulness does for a
          couple or family is that you will learn about patience, tolerance and understanding your
          emotions which are all vital in sustaining a healthy relationship.
